# Review of dataset literature:

### AMIGOS (2018)

* Audio, Visual, Depth, EEG, GSR, ECG
* Emotion, personality and mood with social context (tests done alone and in groups)
* Personality profiled via big-five, mood profiled via PANAS (Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedules)
* Experiment 1 - Short videos in an individual setting
* Experiment 2 - Long videos in a mixture of individual and group settings
* Physiological signals recorded using commercial wearable sensors that allow more freedom than conventional laboratory equipment
* Internal and external annotations of the participants affective state
* EEG was the best modality for prediction of valence and arousal, while feature level fusion did not improve the results
* For prediction of personality traits, PANAS and social context, GSR of long videos is the best modality over all dimensions
* Feature level fusion improved the results for NA and PA prediction

### ASCERTAIN (2016)

* Facial landmarks, EEG, GSR, ECG
* First physiological database combing both emotion and personality recognition
* Uses wearable, off-the-shelf sensors
* Correlations among affective and personality attributes
* Showing movie clips while recording physiological responses and explicit feedback + big-five questionnaires
* 36 videos, ~90 minute sessions
